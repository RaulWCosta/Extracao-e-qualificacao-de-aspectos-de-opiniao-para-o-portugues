    '''Scores normalization candidates using only their frequencies.

    If the the candidate list has already been scored (i.e, is a list of tuples (word, score1, score2...)),
    the frequency will be applied as the **last** sorting criterion.

    Args:
        lex (dictionary): The lexicon dictionary.
        candidates (list (tuple/str)): The list of normalization candidates - either scored (as tuples) or only strings.
        ncands (int): Number of candidates to be returned (i.e, top ``n_cands`` will be returned according to their frequency).
                      By default, all candidates (-1) are returned.

    Returns:
        tuple(str, list (tuple)): The noisy word and a list of tuples with the top ``n_cands`` sorted by their frequency and the score.

def score_by_similarity_metrics(lex, candidates, metrics=[metrics.edit_distance], n_cands=-1, reverse=False):
    '''Scores normalization candidates using similarity metrics.

    Each metric in ``metrics`` will be applied following the list order.
    That means that candidates will be sorted firstly by metrics[0], **then** by metrics[1] and so on...

    Note:
        The candidates will be sorted in the same order for every metric, so choose metrics accordingly.

    Args:
        lex (dictionary): The lexicon dictionary.
        word (string): The word to be normalized.
        candidates (list (function)): The list of metrics to be applied.
        ncands (int): Number of candidates to be returned (i.e, top ``n_cands`` will be returned according to their position).
                      By default, all candidates (-1) are returned.
        reverse (boolean): Which order to sort the candidate list. False = in ascending order according to the metric (higher value = higher similarity).

    Returns:
        list (tuple): A list of tuples with the top ``n_cands`` sorted by each of the metrics and the scores.
